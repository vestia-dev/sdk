Before you get started with the Vestia SDK, it can be helpful to understand a little bit about the Vestia platform as a whole before jumping in head first.

If you're already familiar, feel free to skip this part and jump straight to the <a href="/docs/getting-started">Getting Started</a> guide.

## The API

From the beginning, Vestia was designed to be incredibly flexible to your application.
Some call this 'headless' or 'API-first', but the truth is we don't mind what it's
called - we care about integrating fluently with your tech stack. That's why we built
the 'front-end' part of our platform in an open-source way. We'll provide you with
everything you need to get a Vestia application running, but if you'd prefer to do
things your own way - that's fine too. The Vestia SDK is made up of a few packages
that will be helpful to different people. The `@vestia/react` package comes with
pre-built React components, whilst the `@vestia/api` package has a barebones API
client for interacting directly with the Vestia API. You might choose to use both
or none of these - the choice is yours.

## The right tool for the job

Vestia has many helpful features, which is what makes it such a powerful platform.
We believe there's a lot of value in having all your tools under one roof. However,
the reality is you may decide you only need one or two of the features that Vestia
provides. That's why the flexibility of the Vestia SDK is so great (at least we like
to think so). For example, you may only need to use Vestia for controlling your feature
flags. If that's the case, you can tailor your application completely around that.
In time, as you become more familiar with the platform, we would hope you choose
to adopt more of the Vestia suite of tools.
